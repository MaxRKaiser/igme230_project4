        <p class="page_description">For this project I built most everything from scratch, without the aid of external libraries
        or templates. I did, however, base my navigation header heavily on the flexbox implementation from in-class.</p>
        <p class="page_description">To complete the task I had to revisit creating native SVG shapes and using javascript, as I
        was pretty rusty. Additionally, I had to look into how to get SVGs and CSS/javascript to properly interact.</p>
        <p class="page_description">As far as above and beyond work, I used a mix of both CSS animations and javascript in my main page
         in order to maximize user engamement. Additionally, I extended the application of flexbox to be used on images, links, and
        text affected by javascript. Rather than simply use CSS animations that I was already familiar with, I sought
         to incorporate new uses of javascript that I hadn't tried before, including tying it between SVGs and buttons, and playing
         around with different inputs and event listeners. In cases such as demo 3, I used javascript functions to add and remove CSS
         classes so that a particular CSS animation could be played when a certain button is pressed. Both infinite and set interval
        animations were used.</p>
