--------------------------------

I plan to work alone for this project.

For my first graphic, I will create a simple shape on the screen. Using keyboard input the user will be able to grow and shrink the shape. The shape should shift through the color spectrum based on its size.

For my second graphic I would like to produce a simple shape on screen. The user will then be able to use keyboard or mouse input to move the shape around. Pressing a button will shoot off a copy of the shape.

For my final graphic I want to make some collision-based game based on only simple shapes (if I can get it to work). The back up will just be generating shapes in random sizes and locations and animating them. I plan for the game to either be a maze, a very simple endless runner, or a locked-in-place shooter. 

For the navigation page, I plan to just have an image for each graphic displayed on the page. You click on the image (which should grow a bit on hover to show that you can interact with it) to navigate. I will probably add a very simple header and footer just to make the page look more complete.

A documentation page will have a header and footer, as well as some basic formatted text explaining what I did. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the final project, I implemented a flexbox-based navigation header adapted from previous assignments. This header, along with a heavily modified version of my go-to CSS was used for all pages. Unlike my inital plans, the SVG demo 1 does not change color in addition to resizing. I decided that having two separate visual changes was unecessary for a simple demo. Similarly, the second demo was changed to only incorporate movement, while the last demo took the role of budding (originally given to demo 2). A documentation page detailing more specifics was added.
